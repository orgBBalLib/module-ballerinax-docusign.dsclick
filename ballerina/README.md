## Overview

[DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com/) is a leading electronic signature and agreement cloud platform that enables organizations to automate and connect the entire agreement process, from preparing and signing to acting on and managing contracts and documents.

The `ballerinax/docusign.dsclick` package offers APIs to connect and interact with [DocuSign Click API](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/click-api/) endpoints, specifically based on [DocuSign Click API v1](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/click-api/reference/).
## Setup guide

To use the DocuSign Click connector, you must have access to the DocuSign Click API through a [DocuSign developer account](https://developers.docusign.com/) and obtain an API access token. If you do not have a DocuSign account, you can sign up for one [here](https://www.docusign.com/free-trial).

### Step 1: Create a DocuSign Account

1. Navigate to the [DocuSign website](https://www.docusign.com/) and sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.

2. For development and testing purposes, create a free developer account on the [DocuSign Developer Portal](https://developers.docusign.com/). For production use, ensure you have a DocuSign eSignature plan that includes Click API access, as Click is available as an add-on feature to qualifying plans.

### Step 2: Generate an API Access Token

1. Log in to your DocuSign Developer account at [developers.docusign.com](https://developers.docusign.com/).

2. Navigate to **My Apps & Keys** from the account menu (click your profile icon in the top right corner).

3. Click **Add App and Integration Key** to create a new application and generate an Integration Key (Client ID).

4. Configure your application's authentication settings by adding a redirect URI and selecting the appropriate authentication method (Authorization Code Grant or JWT).

5. To generate an access token for testing, you can use the **Get Access Token** feature in the DocuSign Developer Portal, or implement the OAuth 2.0 flow in your application.

> **Tip:** You must copy and store this key somewhere safe. It won't be visible again in your account settings for security reasons.
## Quickstart

To use the `docusign.dsclick` connector in your Ballerina application, update the `.bal` file as follows:

### Step 1: Import the module

```ballerina
import ballerinax/docusign.dsclick as dsclick;
```

### Step 2: Instantiate a new connector

Create a `dsclick:ConnectionConfig` and initialize the client:

```ballerina
final dsclick:Client dsclickClient = check new();
```

### Step 3: Invoke the connector operation

Now, utilize the available connector operations.

#### Create a clickwrap

```ballerina
public function main() returns error? {
    dsclick:ClickwrapRequest newClickwrap = {
        clickwrapName: "Terms of Service Agreement",
        documents: [
            {
                documentName: "Terms of Service",
                documentHtml: "<html><body><h1>Terms of Service</h1><p>Please read and accept our terms.</p></body></html>",
                'order: 1
            }
        ],
        displaySettings: {
            displayName: "Terms of Service",
            requireAccept: true,
            mustRead: true,
            consentButtonText: "I Agree"
        },
        status: {
            "value": "active"
        }
    };

    http:Response response = check dsclickClient->/v1/accounts/["<Your_Account_ID>"]/clickwraps.post(newClickwrap);
}
```

### Step 4: Run the Ballerina application

```bash
bal run
```
